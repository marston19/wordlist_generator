# wordlist_generator

A simple tool to generate (lowercase) wordlists from text files. 

Includes:
- Keep It Simple wordlist: a barebones script I made to use with the Hamlet room on TryHackMe
- wordlist_generator.py: a more robust script intended to be a CLI tool.

Planned updates:
- Multithreading/Multiprocessing to handle larger files.
- Remove defaulting to lowercase, expand options to allow users to choose these manipulations.
- Read from other file types
- Create new wordlists from variations and permutations?
